"123456_1_1"	"If The Hobbit doesn't equal the achievement of Jackson's earlier Middle-earth movies -- and, honestly, what could? -- it is still, in sum, a thrilling effort."
"123456_1_1"	"A fitting conclusion to Jackson’s prequel trilogy and a triumphant adieu to Middle-earth. Now complete, The Hobbit stands as a worthy successor to The Lord Of The Rings, albeit one that never quite emerges from its shadow."
"123456_1_1"	"A great ending to one of the best trilogies in its genre. I loved every part. Great in every possible way. We will all miss this characters, Middle Earth and Peter Jackson audacity and creative vision. All six films are now part of the greatest fantasy films ever made. I'm glad i had the chance to witness them all."
"123456_1_0"	"A fucking end to a fucking trilogy made in the grand mindless tradition of the Transformers movies. I can't express how much I didn't want to go and see this, but I wanted to get it over with, much like my experience of watching the third and final Matrix movie.But The Matrix Trilogy was far superior to this garbage, which I'm sure, buried beneath all of the extra crap, there's still a movie to be salvaged.I look forward to viewing a proper edit, where all three Hobbit movies are condensed into one 2-3 hr sitting, and all of the ridiculous  fucking is gone."
"123456_1_0"	"Before seeing _The Battle of the Five Armies_ today, I told people, "The first two films lacked fidelity to the book, but this one should be better." I figured Jackson wouldn't have to add lots of extraneous invented action scenes because the final third of the book contained plenty of action. Boy, was I wrong. Unnecessary invented characters from the previous films continued to take up screen time in this one, and many new ones were added. Tolkien wouldn't recognize a bunch of grand-scale evildoers or various "good guys" whose relationships were supposed to tug at our hearts, though they turned my stomach instead. The additions included plenty of trite dialogue. When one invented character, in a scene made from whole cloth, was shown weeping over a loved one and asking "Why does it hurt so much?", I just about tossed my Junior Mints. Meanwhile, a character largely responsible for turning the tide in the book's Battle of Five Armies (note the lack of a "the" before "Five") was shown in the film, without explanation, for about three seconds. Blink and you might miss it. When one baddie was apparently killed, I thought, "If he suddenly jumps up and starts fighting again, I'm leaving." Too bad I didn't follow through on my threat after that excruciatingly predictable plot twist. Did I mention that Dain, confronting the elf warriors, came across as some nightmare parody of John Cleese performing "The Lord of the Fawlty Towers"?.I could go on, but "travesty" is about the kindest word I can use for this mass of claptrap. I now fear that Jackson will film _The Silmarillion_, turning it into yet another tawdry, over-the-top CGI fest."
"123456_2_1"	"This film followed the musical so well, and I loved every second of it! I have always loved the show and its soundtrack and was ecstatic to find out that Disney was making a version of it. I took my mom, who hasn't seen the musical, to see it, and she loved it as well, raving to her friends about it. I understand how people who have not seen the musical were thrown off by the last quarter of the movie, but it wouldn't have been Into the Woods if they deleted parts in order to keep everything "happily ever after" and PC. That's not the point of this show. It's theme is about growing up, from being innocent to learning the truth about the world. You learn that things aren't always as they seem and to be careful what you wish for because you just may get it, and it may not be quite what you expected. The characters' choices are all ridden with impending consequence. It's not bleak, it's reality, while reminding you of the good life holds as well. No this is not your typical children's Disney movie like the classic animated originals, and I was actually pretty surprised at the PG rating. I suppose they kept it because none of the deaths were shown at all, only implied or discussed, but never set on film. There were several children in the theater with me, which I was also surprised to see, but they laughed and enjoyed the film. I think the deeper and darker themes flew right over their heads, and they simply enjoyed the stories, as children do. If you have seen the musical or are a musical enthusiast, you will enjoy this! If you are an unsure parent, check it out beforehand. If you are looking for your usual, run-of-the-mill Disney movie, look elsewhere. Avoid unfairly rating a great movie because it wasn't the typical thing you expected. This movie is amazing."
"123456_2_1"	"Into the Woods debuted on Broadway in October 1987, where it was greeted with great enthusiasm by critics and audiences alike. The narrative is based on four fairy tales, using versions by the Brothers Grimm (Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel). The plot blends the familiar tales with an original story about a baker and his wife and their attempts to undo a witch’s spell. The musical boasts music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, the most respected theatre composer of the last 60 years, and a book by his frequent collaborator, James Lapine. Historically, fairy tales by the Grimm Brothers have been viewed as being darker and more realistic than versions of the same stories written by other authors. Consequently, and because Mr. Sondheim is seen as one of the most (if not the most) challenging composers of modern theatre, it must be noted that Into the Woods is not a piece that was conceived with an audience of young children in mind. Rather, it is a sophisticated adult experience, a fairy tale for grownups if you will. While some of the darker and more provocative aspects of the story have been muted for the film version, the fact that the film has been produced by Disney has led many parents to assume that this is a film for small children. It is not. It is a moral fable for grownups; most children under the age of fifteen or so (unless they are very mature) will not be able to appreciate the story, and many parents of small children will find the material unsuitable."
"123456_3_0"	"I enjoy watching comedy but this movie was just horrible. The plot line was stupid. The acting was poor. Overall it was a complete waste of money and time. The special effects were low budget. There was only once scene that really made me laugh. If you want get understand the film then all you really need to do is watch the trailer. Save your money and see another film. I of course did not see Hot Tub Time Machine 1 so perhaps I was missing some key plot lines. There are plenty of other movies that are worth your time. Save your money and time for them"
"123456_4_1"	"Technically,one of the last movies released in 2014 on the year's final day, just in time for award season, cause it's that type of movie to impress awardees. I do praise the movie, especially for it's stylized throwback to the late 70s-early 80s when the movie takes place , 1981 to be precise. Oscar Isaac is becoming the man to watch out for. He never seemed like a leading man type, but after seeing him in Inside Llewyn Davis and this, I'm having a change of opinion. David Oyelowo is another one I need to watch out for, although it's not hard, as he's been appearing in a lot of films, and gives a great performance no matter how small his supporting role is. The lovely Jessica Chastain is in the movie as well, being very brilliant and very sexy. I only wish she had more time on screen cause she's lovely to watch in all aspects. The film also stars Albert Brooks in a role I feel he got because of his outstanding performance in Drive. It's a very quiet movie with a lot of the drama coming from things not said but suggested. Not much action, but the little bit did get my blood pumping. It also had humor in the drama. It really does feel like it was done in 1981 too. Such a brilliant job by the filmmakers."
"123456_5_0"	"I cannot begin to list all the things wrong with this movie. This is a completely pointless, sadistic and uninspiring movie. It is nothing close to the uplifting celebration of the human spirit, strength and persistence that the trailer promises. "They can arrest and torture you, but if you pray and believe in god, everything will be fine". Wow! How easy everything is. This movie is elevated, stupid, gooey and implausible. the message: " Don't loose your pride and your faith and everything will be fine". This movie is like the director: Fluffed up! boastful and self-important, but behind the facade is not very much."
"123456_6_0"	"Hollywood plundering Japanese pop culture isn't something new. From "Americanizing" television series for the kids from Power Rangers to Ultraman, and adapting famed characters from Japanese film, games and manga to frequent disastrous effect, it still wouldn't stop the studios from going after one property after another. This time round it's the long running Dragonball series, because the assumption is that the built-in fan base would translate to instant dollars at the box office. Not. You have to give the filmmakers a little bit of credit though, being either foolhardy, or just plain ballsy. It's a given that they cannot condense and distill the rich content into a surprisingly less than 90 minute movie, and live in the hopes of producing a sequel, or to generate a franchise (i.e. don't leave the cinema hall when the end credits start to roll). But what they successfully do, is to super-summarize the entire mythos by throwing out everything except the main gist of the entire manga, making it extremely simplistic in poor lazy-man standards in adaptation. For the uninitiated, the film would serve as a quick launchpad to the original manga. For those with a wee bit of knowledge of what it's about (like myself), the film just treads along the same lines and doesn't offer you new information. For the fanboys, I guess you'll only get some kicks at seeing some of your favorite characters come alive, only that they look more Caucasian, and have a head full of hair when they're not supposed to (someone forgot to insist that in the contract?) That's all you're gonna get. Period. As far as film-making and story-telling techniques go, you can see cliché after cliché being thrown at you, with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized, and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical know-it-all like in Kung Pu Panda), and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi (Jamie Chung). Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo (an instant shoo-in as one of the worst cinematic villains, ever!) and his temporary sidekick Mai (Eriko Tamura) who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship, in the form of irritating tech-wizard Bulma (Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon), mercenary Yum Cha (Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T) and Chow Yun-Fat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act cute as Master Roshi, who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku. Speaking of time, or the lack thereof, everything is compressed. From two weeks to two days and the day of the blood moon shielding the yellow sun (OK so I made that up), everything moves at so fast a pace, that all you get are cheesy lines of dialog, and an excuse to paste some action sequences together. And James Wong certainly can't direct action (despite being at the helm of Jet Li's The One, which was of course bland and bad), opting to pay homage to Zack Snyder's slow-mo technique, and midway changing the style to having the camera being too close to the action, in the dark, coupled with quick MTV cuts that you don't get to see a thing. And the rush job just doesn't stop at the narrative or the action. Special effects wise, they look really cheap, and I wonder whether Producer Stephen Chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his Kung Fu Hustle done many years ago. Ayumi Hamasaki's contribution of the theme song Rule sounded really bad as well (I may get flak from her fans), and I guess having some Asian participation doesn't legitimize what is essentially a poorly done movie. Not even Chow Yun-Fat's star status could save this, and you wonder what figured when this is the movie that he gave up Red Cliff for. This is basically a movie that only children below the age of 5 will enjoy tremendously, despite having to see 6 half-balls, contributed courtesy of the 3 lead female characters, being continuously flashed on screen, thanks to some neck plunging wardrobe (where's that malfunction when you need one?) Totally bland and really uninteresting, I would suggest sticking to the manga instead."
"123456_7_0"	"This movie is really a terrible portrayal of the events that really occurred. Guilty until proved innocent more like it. The acting was quite cold and lifeless and yet should the directors have taken their time with this storyline it could of had real potential. Such a shame to butcher a possible great. The main reason that such a film would be made is to shed some light on the events that occurred in real life or at least a resemblance. I do not believe that this was the case here. Throughout the film we see a great disparity between the actors and what one would expect from a man of such influence. How can anyone give this film a high rating after having to struggle to get to the finally."
